The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to modify existing records in a table. You can update one or more rows based on a condition.

        Syntax:
        UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;

        UPDATE Customers SET CustomerName = 'Cardinal John' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
        
        Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
